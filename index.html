		<summary>Rain fell gently on the tin roof.</summary>
		<p>The pitter patter knocking out the rhythm above your head is relaxing, reminding you of so many summers spent waiting for the eventual relief of the brief storms.</p>

		<p>It would be pleasant to lie here and reminisce, but that seems like a bad idea. Considering you're bleeding out.</p>

		<p>There isn't much in the remnants of the old tin shed, one of the only structures still standing on the farm.</p>

		<details id="e5995d9354">
			<summary>A mouldy apple.</summary>

			<p>It's really gross. And you have no idea how to turn mould that might be penicillin into actual medicine.</p>

			<p>Now seems like a bad time to try to learn.</p>
		</details>

		<details id="e874c94842">
			<summary>A dead rat the size of a cat.</summary>

			<p>The only surprising part of this is that you managed to actually kill the damn thing with your bare hands before it killed you.</p>

			<p>Well... Killed you all at once.</p>
		</details>

		<details id="9d6183c16e">
			<summary><mark>The torn remnants of your shirt.</mark></summary>

			<p>Considering what the rat did, it isn't surprising it is torn up.</p>

			<p>It seems like a bad idea, what with the bacteria that rats carry, but wrapping it around your wound from the bite on your side seems to be the only immediate choice to make.</p>

			<details id="5087ae5609">
				<summary><mark>You use the shirt to bandage the wound.</mark></summary>

				<p>Now what?</p>

				<p>You're still bleeding.<wbr>It's still raining.<wbr>The rat is still dead.</p>

				<details id="a4b73eb1d7">
					<summary><mark>You pass out.</mark></summary>

					<h1>Wake up.</h1>

					<details id="f53430e234">
						<summary><mark>Oblige the crazy loud voice and wake up.</mark></summary>

						<p>Cracking open an eye, you see something that could not possibly account for the insanely loud voice.</p>

						<p>A small, probably growth-stunted, young girl. At least... She looks almost like a girl.</p>

						<p>Her bare arms outside her t-shirt are covered in red scales, as are her cheeks.</p>

						<p>Must be some kind of inhuman.</p>

						<p>Glancing at your side you see that the shirt is gone, and replaced by a proper bandage.</p>

						<details id="1ab7e189c8">
							<summary>Inhuman?</summary>

							<p>Inhuman is the catch-all term used by the dominant species of the planet to describe all the sentient, or near-sentient species that should probably be considered equals, but are mostly looked down on.</p>

							<p><q>Mmm.</q></p>

							<p>Well, that was extraordinarily descriptive.</p>

							<p>She stares at you for a little while, and then sits down, a tail curling out from the bottom of her shirt to go around her feet and hands. She smiles at you, <q>Rat.</q></p>

							<p>Well, you did know that much.</p>

							<details id="c1fb97599f">
								<summary><mark>Ask her name?</mark></summary>

								<p><q>Maly Kiel.</q> She said happily, before sniffing the air. Her golden eyes narrowed and she let out a low growl as she looked outside the tin building.</p>

								<p>You hadn't heard anything. Not even the skittering of a rat.</p>

								<p><q>Przekleta bestia.</q> She said in anger before diving out of the doorway on all fours.</p>

								<details id="51151de75c">
									<summary>Przekleta bestia...</summary>

									<p>An older term. Meaning "cursed beast" or similiar. Generally used to refer to inhumans that have picked up a curse that has taken their minds from them.</p>

									<p>Not that dissimilar to what rabies can do to a human if left unchecked.</p>
								</details>

								<details id="0d37bba500">
									<summary>Maly Kiel...</summary>

									<p>It sounds like a cute name on the surface. Except it's less of a name, and more of a description.</p>

									<p>Directly translated, it means "Little Fang".</p>

									<p>Something like a nickname, then. Maybe.</p>
								</details>

								<details id="0347483d9a">
									<summary><mark>Crawl to the doorway.</mark></summary>

									<p>From your vantage point you can see the cursed beast at the edge of the wheat field that has sprung up outside.</p>

									<p>It and the young girl are circling each other, both growling.</p>

									<p>The beast's hackles are up. Shadows seem to swirl around it, to be a part of it. It is difficult to tell what it once was, before the curse took root. Too hard to tell if it was even bipedal before the curse. Whatever it was... That's long gone.</p>

									<p>The girl on the other hand doesn't look cute and innocent anymore. Her golden eyes are those of a killer. Unblinking, unafraid. Her shoulders are braced, her tail floating to keep her balanced.</p>

									<p>You nearly died fighting a stupid rat.</p>

									<p>What on earth is she thinking taking on a cursed beast all on her own?</p>

						<p>The warmth encompasses you, as you fall deeper into the darkness and the peace.</p>

						<p>The voice that tried to shatter your ears disappears like smoke as you continue to drop away from the world.</p>

						<p>Forever.</p>
