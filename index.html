		<summary>Rain fell gently on the tin roof.</summary>
		<p>The pitter patter knocking out the rhythm above your head is relaxing, reminding you of so many summers spent waiting for the eventual relief of the brief storms.</p>

		<p>It would be pleasant to lie here and reminisce, but that seems like a bad idea. Considering you're bleeding out.</p>

		<p>There isn't much in the remnants of the old tin shed, one of the only structures still standing on the farm.</p>

		<details id="e5995d9354">
			<summary>A mouldy apple.</summary>

			<p>It's really gross. And you have no idea how to turn mould that might be penicillin into actual medicine.</p>

			<p>Now seems like a bad time to try to learn.</p>
		</details>

		<details id="e874c94842">
			<summary>A dead rat the size of a cat.</summary>

			<p>The only surprising part of this is that you managed to actually kill the damn thing with your bare hands before it killed you.</p>

			<p>Well... Killed you all at once.</p>
		</details>

		<details id="9d6183c16e">
			<summary><mark>The torn remnants of your shirt.</mark></summary>

			<p>Considering what the rat did, it isn't surprising it is torn up.</p>

			<p>It seems like a bad idea, what with the bacteria that rats carry, but wrapping it around your wound from the bite on your side seems to be the only immediate choice to make.</p>

			<details id="5087ae5609">
				<summary><mark>You use the shirt to bandage the wound.</mark></summary>

				<p>Now what?</p>

				<p>You're still bleeding.<wbr>It's still raining.<wbr>The rat is still dead.</p>

				<details id="a4b73eb1d7">
					<summary><mark>You pass out.</mark></summary>

					<h1>Wake up.</h1>

					<details id="f53430e234">
						<summary><mark>Oblige the crazy loud voice and wake up.</mark></summary>

						<p>Cracking open an eye, you see something that could not possibly account for the insanely loud voice.</p>

						<p>A small, probably growth-stunted, young girl. At least... She looks almost like a girl.</p>

						<p>Her bare arms outside her t-shirt are covered in red scales, as are her cheeks.</p>

						<p>Must be some kind of inhuman.</p>

						<p>Glancing at your side you see that the shirt is gone, and replaced by a proper bandage.</p>

						<details id="1ab7e189c8">
							<summary>Inhuman?</summary>

							<p>Inhuman is the catch-all term used by the dominant species of the planet to describe all the sentient, or near-sentient species that should probably be considered equals, but are mostly looked down on.</p>

					<details id="101ef5342e">
						<summary><mark>Continue to sleep.</mark></summary>
						<p>The warmth encompasses you, as you fall deeper into the darkness and the peace.</p>

						<p>The voice that tried to shatter your ears disappears like smoke as you continue to drop away from the world.</p>

						<p>Forever.</p>
